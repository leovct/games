# Godot games and prototypes :video_game:
![godot-ci export](https://github.com/leovct/godot/workflows/godot-ci%20export/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)

**This repository contains games and prototypes that I developed using the game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).**  

_If you want to try one of them, **you can visit this [website](https://leovct.github.io/godot/)** or you can also [download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/linux) (it is available on Linux, macOS and Windows). Then pull the repository and import the file "project.godot" of the game you want to play. Finally, start the project in Godot and launch it with F5._
